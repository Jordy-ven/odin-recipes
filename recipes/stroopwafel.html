        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the stroop, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar and butter are melted and the mix just comes to a boil. Transfer the filling to a bowl and set aside to cool. 7 oz Dutch Stroop,4 oz brown sugar,3 oz unsalted butter,1 teaspoons ground cinnamon,1/8 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>Combine the milk and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl. Use the beater and mix until the yeast is dissolved. Add the eggs, melted butter and sugar. 2 oz whole milk,2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast,2 each large eggs,5 oz granulated sugar,6 oz unsalted butter</li>
        <li>With the mixer running on low, add the cinnamon and salt. Add the flour and mix until most of the flour is incorporated. Turn the dough out into a lightly floured surface and knead into a ball. The dough is quite soft. 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon,1/4 teaspoon table salt,15 oz all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 18 pieces, each piece should weigh about 50g. Roll each piece to a ball and line them up on a sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and set the dough aside for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the waffle iron. Take a ball of dough and flatten it to a disc. Place it on the waffle iron and close the iron.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Use a fork to lift the waffle off the iron. Immediately use a knife with a thin sharp blade to split and open up the waffle. Generously spread the inside of the waffle with stroop (about a tablespoon) and sandwich the two halves together. Continue with the remaining dough.</li>
    </ol>
